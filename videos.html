                <p>
                    This video tells us what Gyasi Linje, a software engineer, works in one day.
                    We will learn what he does in his job to understand more about it. According to the video, he left
                    his home quite early
                    in the morning to go to work place. He checks his mail and meet with some internships.
                    Then, he spends most of the time to coding. It takes him about 4 to 5 hours a day to doing it.
                    Moreover, he also spends 1 to 2 hours to do some design about new project. He also divides the time
                    to play some sports and
                    relax in order to keep him healthy. I think coding is the most difficult for him while working
                    because he has to do it alone
                    so there will be a lot of work to do. However, he still divides the time properly to relax and play
                    some sports which should
                    be done by many other IT professionals to keep healthy.

                    Bangalore for 5 years. He wakes up very early at the morning to do exercises.
                    Then, he heads to his company which is a very long progress due to a traffic congestion at India.
                    After that, he starts to work at 9 and he pay a lot of attention to his work.
                    This video doesn’t focus on his IT work so I can’t know much about his work.
                    However, the way he balances his life is very respectful and we should learn that from him.</p>

                    Then, he starts to design his logo project by brainstorming ideas which are related to the project’s
                    context.

                <p>Summary and explain: </p>
                <p>It may very interesting to become a game developer, a job that you can show your imagination to
                    everybody.
                    Although the developer still a student, I think he will have some specific skills in his major and
                    also closer
                    to all other students.
                    Starting a day with breakfast is a necessary thing to do for everybody. Then he begins to plan
                    things he needs to
                    finish in a day on his notebook in order to keep focus on his progress. Next, he checks the comment
                    to find some advices
                    about his game to make it look better like adding some heat wave effect or smoke effect. He works in
                    the group have
                    4 people to develop a game which is created by Java. He is very positive when taking people comments
                    so I think he is
                    very friendly and he ending his day by going out for gym and keep progressing his game.</p>

                        releasing application
                        or new website. I think to become an IT support is very difficult due to his information about
                        his
                        job.
                        He has to know a little about everything in IT industry, especially about software to provide
