                    <p> My name is Minh Anh and people often call me MA and I come from Vietnam. My iD is S3863946 and my email address is s3863946@rmit.edu.vn. My hobbies during free days are hanging out with my family and having meaningful weekend activities with my family. I don't have too much time with my family so I usually stay home on weekends or go with my family. The main reason I love IT is because I want to know in detail about the stuff I use every day, how it is organized and how it works. When I was little I found a lot of fascinating things about computers when I first came across computers and I had a dream that I would do computer related work when I was growing up..</p>

                        With The results of an online Myers-Briggs test, this result shows me my personality that INFPs have a tendency to be introverted, quiet, and reserved. This personality of mine will affect the formation of groups because I am an introvert person so I am difficult to describe my concept and I can not chat with some group members whom I do not know. I think I will work well with Khai who is in same group as me because he has a similar personality to me, I will be easy to exchange information with him. With the results of an online learning style test, I am a visual learner with 45%. This result is very true to me because I learn by reading or seeing pictures I understand and remember everything with my eyes. When I work in a team, I help them set the group's goals and develop the opinion of the members. i am difficult to work with Dung who is a auditory learner because I think I combine well with Dung who is a auditory learner because his ability to hear and absord lessons is very good. With my creativity, this result shows me that my creativity is only 38.65% so in the teamwork, I had a hard time figuring out an idea for the group and I could only understand the opinions of others and develop them.

                    <h5 class="font-weight-normal">Ideal Job</h5>
                    <p>
                        I am intrigued by the software architect job which combined a lot of soft skills such as leadership skills, teamwork skills and communication skills. My job needs conditions quite similar with the jobs of Khai and Dung are we all work with team, have many years experience about software development and know programming in several languages such as HTML, Java and Linux. I think my job will lose over 10 years to achive this job and my job will be harder to achieve than my friendsâ€™s job because it requires worker have to have a high experience in software development and software system architecture. I think my plan is different with my friends because they write clearly the goals of the month and the year and they give themselves the work they need to do. About me, I just write about what I should do to improve subjects such as I decided to take extra classses outside to improve my knowledge and I need to do more exercises in order to remember the lectures well.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="font-weight-normal">Feedback</h5>
                    <p> My team is doing quite well, all members are equally given the same work. Regarding the content, the members give their opinions and we will pick the best concept and develop it together. Khai is the person who writes the most code because he has a lot of knowledge about creating a good website and he did a great job in this aspect. Dung is the one who provides ideas on how to design a website and He also does a good job of consulting each off the members and combining them to get the structure of a website. I and Anh had a lot of arguments about content development and thiss caused a failure to complete on time. Although some members did not complete the work on time, the work they did still met the requirements. To sum up, although there were controversial times wwith each other, the members combined quite well.

                    </p>
