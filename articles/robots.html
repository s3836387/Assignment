                <h2 class="section-heading">What does it do?</h2>
                <p>In the 4.0 era, technology is an area that is being strongly developed and invested in by many
                    countries around the world. Moreover, information technology is an industry attracting a lot of
                    talent and this will be a key industry for the modern world. Robots are a very invested area right
                    now because this will be an area that will help the world do everything by self-destructing. Robots
                    will be at the heart of the future industrial revolutions and it will be used in many ways in
                    healthcare, industry, and especially in security and defense. Robots are often understood to mean
                    mechanics and software come together and are made to do everything automatically and controlled by
                    humans. </p>
                <h4 class="section-heading">Examples</h4>
                <p>
                    Contemporarily, everyone wants to do everything automatically because it helps companies or
                    organizations reduce their number of employees. It is beneficial to many benefits that scientists
                    are investing in to create robots that can benefit society and for science. Scientists have gained
                    some great achievements in the brightness of the robots to serve humans. In Vietnam, we can see the
                    medical field being used by robots to replace human beings to do things that can involve infectious
                    as well as in surgery, which has very high accuracy. </p>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                    <img class="img-fluid d-flex justify-content-center" src="../assets/img/articles/robot-1.png"
                        alt="Demo Image">

                </div>
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-center caption text-muted my-3"> Cu Chi disinfectant robot</div>
                <p>

                    For Instance, the robot has officially replaced
                    the staff in disinfecting the hospital at the CU Chi tunnels. Robots reduce the risk of infection
                    between a sick person and the medical staff. This Robot can be self-sprayed in the antiseptic and
                    after leaving the room with a sick person. In 2016, the world announced Sophia as the most
                    human-like robot in the world and she was created by David Hansion. She is one of the robots with
                    vivid facial expressions and makes people when talking to her seem like communicating with a real
                    person. Self-driving cars are being tested by Google many times and will soon be launched with
                    self-driving cars. Currently, self-driving cars can drive up to 1000km without human intervention or
                    impact. The CEO of Uber has a very disruptive idea when he wants to replace all drivers with smart
                    cars. Cashiers are also the job of being replaced by robots and automatic checkout robots that are
                    present at many grocery stores around the world. It will help people to use their limbs less for
                    labor. Robot service staff is also a new trend for now because it will miss people more than regular
                    staff. In Hanoi, there is a shop that has used a robot instead of the restaurant's service staff and
                    it stimulates curiosity and wants to be served with human robots. It will be replaced by many stores
                    over the next several years as it will make it possible for people to reduce manual use. Although
                    using robots is very convenient for many things, we humans need to spend a lot of money to develop
                    and replace robots when doing something. The economy is playing a huge role in robot development so
                    when we want to use robots, we need to invest in technology as well as software development to make
                    it the most complete. It needs to be tried many times before it can be put on the market for the
                    consumer because when we try it, it is easy to spot the error and be able to fix it quickly.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">What is the likely impact?</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/articles/robot-2.jpg" alt="Demo Image">
                <span class="caption text-muted my-3">Snake robot for rescueing people stuck under rubbles</span>
                <p class="my-4"> In the modern world, exporting robots is a rather attractive industry because it is bringing a lot
                    of profits as well as the modern world of day by day. Not stopping there, it also helps to make the
                    world more modern and is turning the world into automation. Robots will change people to do things
                    that are difficult and dangerous and will lessen the difficulties for humans. In my opinion,
                    automation is what scientists are aiming for and plan to apply it to many countries around the
                    world. Automation will help people have an easier and safer life when being controlled by the same
                    system. For example, smart cars with the same operating system will help many countries reduce
                    traffic jams and will reduce a very large number of accidents. When being on the same system, the
                    car will find another way to move or avoid the cars in front of them and will greatly reduce the
                    risks that traffic brings.The robot service staff also reduces the number of staff to hire and it
                    also helps increase sales for the restaurant because it will be a special point to create that
                    restaurant. on the other hand, employees will be severely affected by unemployment. It will leave a
                    lot of people unemployed when restaurants decide to switch from using humans to robots for
                    service.When robots are dominant in their manual activities, they will cause unemployment in many
                    parts of the world. Because, investors do not need to hire many employees when replacement robots
                    are available. This is a bad point coming from robots when it comes to potential consequences within
                    its use.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">How will this affect you?</h2>

                <p> Contemporarily, robots are gaining priority in the fields and chores are no exception. We can own
                    robots that clean the house and vacuum with ease. It has affected my life a lot because I don't need
                    to pay attention to chores too much. When I returned home and my house was not clean, I had robots
                    to worry about, so it made me feel not interested in doing housework. It was very different for me
                    because normally I would be the housekeeper and now I will replace it with something else. It makes
                    people lead a passive life and doesn't want to use their limbs to work. It doesn't matter too much
                    in our lives, but I think the phone is the one that separates and makes people spend less time
                    together. Phones are creating an invisible wall for family members as well as for friends. For
                    example, when I went to a cafe with my friends, the first thing some of them did was ask for the
                    wifi password and just click on the phone until the end of the cafe session. It makes me feel
                    unhappy when the phone is doing things I cannot imagine.</p>
