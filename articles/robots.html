                <h2 class="section-heading">What does it do?</h2>
                <p>In the 4.0 era, technology is an area that is being strongly developed and invested in by many countries around the world. Moreover, information technology is an industry attracting a lot of talent and this will be a key industry for the modern world. Robots are a very invested area right now because this will be an area that will help the world do everything by self-destructing. Robots will be at the heart of the future industrial revolutions and it will be used in many ways in healthcare, industry, and especially in security and defense. Robots are often understood to mean mechanics and software come together and are made to do everything automatically and controlled by humans. Contemporarily, everyone wants to do everything automatically because it helps companies or organizations reduce their number of employees. It is beneficial to many benefits that scientists are investing in to create robots that can benefit society and for science. Scientists have gained some great achievements in the brightness of the robots to serve humans. In Vietnam, we can see the medical field being used by robots to replace human beings to do things that can involve infectious as well as in surgery, which has very high accuracy. For Instance, the robot has officially replaced the staff in disinfecting the hospital at the CU Chi tunnels. Robots reduce the risk of infection between a sick person and the medical staff. This Robot can be self-sprayed in the antiseptic and after leaving the room with a sick person. In 2016, the world announced Sophia as the most human-like robot in the world and she was created by David Hansion. She is one of the robots with vivid facial expressions and makes people when talking to her seem like communicating with a real person. Self-driving cars are being tested by Google many times and will soon be launched with self-driving cars.  Currently, self-driving cars can drive up to 1000km without human intervention or impact.  The CEO of Uber has a very disruptive idea when he wants to replace all drivers with smart cars. Cashiers are also the job of being replaced by robots and automatic checkout robots that are present at many grocery stores around the world.  It will help people to use their limbs less for labor. Robot service staff is also a new trend for now because it will miss people more than regular staff.  In Hanoi, there is a shop that has used a robot instead of the restaurant's service staff and it stimulates curiosity and wants to be served with human robots.  It will be replaced by many stores over the next several years as it will make it possible for people to reduce manual use. Although using robots is very convenient for many things, we humans need to spend a lot of money to develop and replace robots when doing something.  The economy is playing a huge role in robot development so when we want to use robots, we need to invest in technology as well as software development to make it the most complete. It needs to be tried many times before it can be put on the market for the consumer because when we try it, it is easy to spot the error and be able to fix it quickly.

                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Autonomous vehicles today:</h3>
                <p>Billions of dollars invested in autonomous vehicle technology, which has helped people make spectacular strides in the technology age but it also reminds us of how much longer we are going to complete it. Currently, people still do not fully trust autonomous vehicles because no company has yet allowed a fully self-driving ride on all roads without a supervisor. The autonomous vehicle industry split into two camps: the companies that have created very limited technologies for public users ( complex cruise control systems ) and some companies have introduced fully automated technology but under limited circumstance.</p>



                <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                <p> In the modern world, exporting robots is a rather attractive industry because it is bringing a lot of profits as well as the modern world of day by day. Not stopping there, it also helps to make the world more modern and is turning the world into automation. Robots will change people to do things that are difficult and dangerous and will lessen the difficulties for humans.  In my opinion, automation is what scientists are aiming for and plan to apply it to many countries around the world. Automation will help people have an easier and safer life when being controlled by the same system.  For example, smart cars with the same operating system will help many countries reduce traffic jams and will reduce a very large number of accidents.  When being on the same system, the car will find another way to move or avoid the cars in front of them and will greatly reduce the risks that traffic brings.The robot service staff also reduces the number of staff to hire and it also helps increase sales for the restaurant because it will be a special point to create that restaurant.  on the other hand, employees will be severely affected by unemployment.  It will leave a lot of people unemployed when restaurants decide to switch from using humans to robots for service.When robots are dominant in their manual activities, they will cause unemployment in many parts of the world.  Because, investors do not need to hire many employees when replacement robots are available.  This is a bad point coming from robots when it comes to potential consequences within its use.</p>

                <p> Contemporarily, robots are gaining priority in the fields and chores are no exception.  We can own robots that clean the house and vacuum with ease.  It has affected my life a lot because I don't need to pay attention to chores too much.  When I returned home and my house was not clean, I had robots to worry about, so it made me feel not interested in doing housework.  It was very different for me because normally I would be the housekeeper and now I will replace it with something else.  It makes people lead a passive life and doesn't want to use their limbs to work.  It doesn't matter too much in our lives, but I think the phone is the one that separates and makes people spend less time together.  Phones are creating an invisible wall for family members as well as for friends.  For example, when I went to a cafe with my friends, the first thing some of them did was ask for the wifi password and just click on the phone until the end of the cafe session.  It makes me feel unhappy when the phone is doing things I cannot imagine.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                    tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet
                    far
                    too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is
                    a
                    historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
                    development.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the
                    size
                    of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                    fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.
                    Seeing
                    this has to change a man.</p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before –
                    that’s
                    what living is all about.</span>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year
                    mission:
                    to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no
                    man
                    has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a
                    fundamental
                    truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
