                <h2 class="section-heading">What is Cybersecurity ?</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity or information technology security is a kind of protection which keep your computer
                    hardware and software out of harmful things such as viruses or hacker.
                    Moreover, it also helps computer stop services from being disruption and misdirection while working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for the appearance of Cybersecurity :
                </p>
                <p> Due to the development, we have been created so many new types of technology
                    like wireless network and smart devices. On the contrary, it helps people to access
                    to information very easy which is a benefit for hacker to take their personal information.
                    In addition, cybersecurity is now the most important major that all the technology experts
                    have to focus and stop information theft. </p>
                <p>Some categories of Cybersecurity:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Network security</li>
                    <li>Application security</li>
                    <li>Information security</li>
                    <li>Operational security</li>
                    <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity</li>
                    <li>business continuity and End-user education</li>
                    <p> These division allow us to realize the type of damage in order to provide proper solution to
                        every problem. </p>
                </ol>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/articles/cyber1.jpg">
                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">The history of Cybersecurity:</h3>
                <p>Surprisingly, cybersecurity just has been focussed in 2014
                    by Andersson and Reimers. They found that their employees not only hate
                    to care about protecting their organization information but also stop people
                    from doing it for them. This has created a massive hole in information secure
                    and this should be changed by five steps: pre-evaluation, strategic planning,
                    operative planning, implementation and post-evaluation. Moreover, this problem
                    has developed in to worldwide threat and rising in very fast pace.</p>



                <h2 class="section-heading">The figure:</h2>

                <p>In the first nine month of 2019, 7.9 billion of files have been recorded to be exposed according to
                    RiskBased Security.
                    It also two times bigger (112%) than the figure at the same time in 2018.
                    In the next three years, the world may cost about 133.7 billion of dollar to solve the cybersecurity
                    problem.
                    This number may rise more if we delay and ignore the damage causing by cyber threat.
                    Besides many threats like malware, phishing, denial – of – service attack happens so commonly.
                    There is some news threat which have been recorded by U.S, U.K, Australia government like dridex
                    malware, emotet
                    malware and romance scams. They can track the information of user to steal their password and spread
                    it out very fast.
                    In 2019, FBI reported 114 victims has been attacked by romance scams and they have lost total 1.6
                    million of dollar
                    which affect a lot to their financial.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Alternative protection:</h2>
                <p>To protect our information, technology experts have created many other ways beside using password or
                    pin code.
                    First, biometrics has been used widely recently. Our fingerprints, irises, face are being used to
                    avoid
                    people to access to our devices if we lost it. Second, some company like Apple provide a special
                    feature for their phone user. If their phone is stolen, they can use another phone to shut the other
                    down forever and back up the data on the other. Those are ways to avoid information theft but there
                    are no
                    optimize ways because each way has different weakness and it can be break. </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">Therefore, avoid cyber-attacking is not only a mission of business but
                    also a mission for every people. Some simple tips we should remember to protect our information
                    efficiently like changing password regularly every month, make sure your password is strong
                    enough and hard to find out, use trust-worthy anti-virus software, avoid opening spam email because
                    it could transfer virus to your computer.</blockquote>



                <h2 class="section-heading">The impact of Cybersecurity:</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid my-3" src="../assets/img/articles/cyber.jpg">
                <p>For this development, if we can enhance our information protection due to the new type of
                    cybersecurity,
                    we won’t worry about virus, malware or hacker anymore. In these days, information is very important
                    not only for
                    a person but also for a country. It can affect widely from the range of financial to war for a
                    simple information
                    about the price of petrol or the disagreement in policy. Therefore, information security must be put
                    on
                    top priority. We need a lot of engineering about security to enhance the protection.
                    Surprisingly, many businesses and governments allow hackers to help them improve the security system
                    because
                    they know how to access in to security hole and also fix the bug. These changes are being used
                    widely around
                    the world with the help of searching tools. They mostly use very young hackers with have the average
                    old is 12.
                    We have heard that kids found the security hole in Facebook or Google operating system which has
                    been approved
                    inaccessible by many experts. However, it can still be broken and these company get these kids to
                    work for them
                    instead of letting them fall in to crime. By this change, technologies will be developed more as
                    well as
                    more jobs will be appeared to support cybersecurity. In addition, people who work in these fields
                    will get
                    a lot of respect and also a wealthy paid job. Job which inhibit and damage the security will slowly
                    get rid of
                    by the trend of the world. </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">How Cybersecurity affect to myself and peple:</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid my-4" src="../assets/img/articles/cyber2.jpg">
                <p>With the help of news security, I can make sure that no one can access to my phone, read my message
                    or see my picture and
                    private information. They have to use my fingerprints, irises or my face. However, these still not
                    very good and may
                    have mistake so you shouldn’t let anyone use your phone without your permission. Not only phone has
                    been installed these
                    kinds of protection but also computer, especially laptop. Asus and Apple are the pioneers in using
                    biometrics instead of password.
                    And I totally agree with these changes because it will keep my information safe and keep out of
                    danger at good at possible.
                    I used to use password such as pin code or pattern but it can be track and remember easily. In
                    addition, I adapt to change and
                    now I use fingerprints in all of my devices. However, my families still found it very hard to use
                    biometrics.
                    My mother and father still using password. It is very dangerous because people tend to create
                    password base on
                    their personal information like name or date-of-birth. In addition, some hacker can access to your
                    phone easily and can steal
                    your information which can use it to fight against you or use it like a blackmail. Therefore, we
                    must check our phone and
                    change password regularly every month to avoid leaking information because hackers can take that to
                    do harm to you and your
                    families. </p>
