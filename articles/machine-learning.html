                <h2 class="section-heading">What does it do?</h2>
                <p>Machine learning is a subfield of AI, in which the machine makes a prediction or product a result
                    based on past data or experiences. Machine learning algorithms use statistics to find common
                    patterns in a massive amount of data and use that pattern to make an accurate prediction.
                    Furthermore, if the information can be stored digitally, it can be fed to the machine-learning
                    algorithm.</p>
                <p>
                    There are a few techniques that machine learning used:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supervised learning</li>
                    <li>Unsupervised learning</li>
                    <li>Semi-supervised learning</li>
                    <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Supervised learning</h3>
                <p>In this approach, the algorithm is trained by given <strong> labeled</strong> inputs and expected
                    outputs, then the
                    algorithm will try to figure out the pattern (relationship) between the two data. This technique
                    is divided into main types: <strong>Classification </strong> and <strong>Recession</strong>. The
                    classification algorithm focuses
                    on discrete output, where the main goal is to predict the output as accurately as possible. The
                    recession algorithm focuses on continuous data, where the main goal is to predict the output as
                    close to the actual output as possible.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Unsupervised learning</h3>
                <p>In this approach, the algorithm is given <strong>unlabeled</strong> inputs and no output. The
                    algorithm will then try
                    to figure out the hidden pattern between the data. Furthermore, unsupervised learning is grouped
                    into two types: <strong>Clustering </strong>and <strong>Association</strong>. In the clustering
                    algorithm, it will find a pattern or a
                    structure in a collection of unlabeled data. In the association algorithm, it will find the
                    relationship between two (or more) data object inside a large database.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Semi-supervised learning</h3>
                <p>This approach is a hybrid between unsupervised and supervised learning, where the algorithm will take
                    in partially labeled data and determine the relationship between those data. Because of that, this
                    technique can be used where there is a lack of quality data. Moreover, this technique has yielded
                    accurate results and is more suitable for many real-world problems.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Reinforcement learning</h3>
                <p>this is the latest approach in machine learning, where the algorithm will learn from trial and errors
                    to achieve its goal. The algorithm will try to do different things and are rewarded (or rated) based
                    on whether the action helps to reach its goal.</p>

                <p>The field is constantly expanding its scope as it is responsible for the majority of AI advancement
                    and application. Because of that, it is used to develop many data-driven applications, where humans
                    cannot process. For example, the recommendation systems on YouTube and Netflix; search engines like
                    Google and Bing; advertisement feeds on Facebook and Instagram. In all of the examples above, each
                    platform will collect as much user data as possible (where you are from, what kind of video do you
                    watch, what you recently search for) and feed those data into a machine-learning algorithm to
                    produce a prediction on what you might want next.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">What is the likely impact?</h2>
                <p>Until now, machine learning and AI have already integrated into our daily lives. It is in the search
                    recommendation, voice/facial recognition, phone support (like Siri), etc. However, one aspect of AI
                    that potentially has a high impact positively and negatively is its automation capability. Moreover,
                    like the industrial revolution, AI will replace and create a lot of jobs. For example, we could see
                    this impact clearly in the manufacturing industry, where many American companies have been using
                    robots more and more. These changes cause an increase in production with fewer resources for the
                    company. However, it also causes a lot of people to lose their current job or force them to change
                    jobs. Many lucky people would be able to make the transition, but some will not, like an older
                    worker who will not be as adaptive. On the order hand, for people who can make the transition, they
                    would have a more well-paid job. Another example is the self-driving car since the AI is not likely
                    to make a mistake or fell asleep, it will reduce the number of accidents on the road when this
                    technology is fully developed. The jobs that AI will be replacing will be a redundant job or a
                    dangerous job where we do not want any error. On that note, to balance that, AI would also create a
                    lot of new jobs. The machine would still need maintenance, so the company would be more likely to
                    retrain their workers to do so. Moreover, since the machine still needs to be trained to do the
                    task, a job like data pruning for training would be created.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">How will this affect you</h2>
                <p>So, because of the fourth industrial revolution of AI, many people would have to adapt to it, myself
                    included. For starter, I have already been using AI in my daily lives, like Google map, search
                    engine, grammar checking engine, etc. So, for my generation, we have already grown up with all these
                    technologies and expected it to evolve in the future. Moreover, because I am an IT student, I have
                    to be able to adapt to different technology and languages almost every new semester. Thanks to that,
                    I would be better prepared for any changes that the AI revolution would cause to the industry and be
                    able to stay ahead of the trend and used the rising advancement of AI as an advantage to boost my
                    career. On that note, in contrast to most science fiction films, AI would be considerably beneficial
                    for humans. As you saw in some of the examples above, AI and machine learning could speed up our
                    technology development significantly, improve our mortality, and could potentially help reverse the
                    effect of climate change. For example, my parent generation would benefit greatly from the medical
                    and technology advancement when they retired. However, for most people who do not have any
                    experience with these technologies, it would be very challenging for them to adapt. Those are the
                    poor, the people who do not have access to the internet (around 50% world population) or the people
                    who have low adaptability. Because of that, in the future, we might see an increase in development
                    toward accessibility for everyone.</p>
