                <h2 class="section-heading">What does it do?</h2>
                <p>An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that operates without human participation because it has the ability to perceive the environment. The passenger is not required to drive the vehicle, as the presence of the passenger in the vehicle is optional. An autonomous vehicle can go anywhere and do everything a traditional car with an experienced driver can do. The creation of autonomous is aimed at reducing accidents, traffic congestion, and CO2 emission. However, The configuration of autonomous vehicles is more complicated than a normal vehicle because it is a combination of many complex systems, applying modern technology such as a safety system for the blind-spot warning, automatic emergency braking.</p>
                <p>
                    There are a few techniques that machine learning used:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supervised learning</li>
                    <li>Unsupervised learning</li>
                    <li>Semi-supervised learning</li>
                    <li>Reinforcement learning</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Autonomous vehicles today:</h3>
                <p>Billions of dollars invested in autonomous vehicle technology, which has helped people make spectacular strides in the technology age but it also reminds us of how much longer we are going to complete it. Currently, people still do not fully trust autonomous vehicles because no company has yet allowed a fully self-driving ride on all roads without a supervisor. The autonomous vehicle industry split into two camps: the companies that have created very limited technologies for public users ( complex cruise control systems ) and some companies have introduced fully automated technology but under limited circumstance.</p>



                <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally,
                    it
                    is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always
                    the
                    thrill of just beginning.</p>

                <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally,

                    the
                    thrill of just beginning.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                    tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet
                    far
                    too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is
                    a
                    historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
                    development.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the
                    size
                    of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                    fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.
                    Seeing
                    this has to change a man.</p>

                <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before –
                    that’s
                    what living is all about.</span>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year
                    mission:
                    to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no
                    man
                    has gone before.</p>

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a
                    fundamental
                    truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
