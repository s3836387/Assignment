                <h2 class="section-heading">Group job</h2>
                <p>My team Ice Tea is made from four people who have a wide choice of jobs like data engineer, product manager, software architect. Those are jobs that have a big impact in the IT industry as well as developing technology. According to Burning Glass, they have given many data about IT so Ice Tea group will use it to evaluate members’s ideal jobs. The soft skills required by the company are in the top 5 by source labour insight jobs (burning glass technologies). However, most companies often require staff to be fluent in javascript, java and python languages. In three specific IT skills ranked highest, the SQL programming language is not required in these companies. However, nearly companies recommend that employees have skills such as communication, organisational skills and problem solving which ranks in top 3..</p>
                <p>
                    
                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Khai</h3>
                <p>My ideal job product manager, but since the job is not in high demand according to Burning Glass
                    data, and I want to gain some experiences first. My second ideal job is Test analyst, which
                    according to Burning Glass 2018 "Labor Insight Jobs" is among the top demand job (555). Furthermore,
                    from the Burning Glass data one of the top generic skills in IT, besides problem-solving skills, is
                    communication. I am a good problem solver but lack face-to-face communication skills. Besides that,
                    one of the skills that surprise me in top IT skills is business skills (analysis, management, and
                    relationship building). However, some of the top IT skills are in my skill set (SQL, Java, C#).
                    Finally, after looking at the Burning Glass data, some of my opinions have changed, like you need a
                    lot of communication skills and some business knowledge. But it does not change what my ideal was.
                </p>



                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Ngan</h2>

                <p>My ideal job is a software architect. My job requires that having at least 10 years of experience in software development  according to labour insight jobs burning glass technologies(532). The software Developer ranks first with top burning glass occuptions(29,456). This job needs organisational skills which usually in the top 5(15,844) from May 2017 to march 2018 about skills in greatest demand. About programming langugues, employees need proficent in HTML and Javascript. JavaSript is always in the top 3(2,946) while HTML is greatly reduced from May 2017 to march 2018. I think i will change my ideal job in the future because I recognize that I will lose 10 years in order to achive this job and it was a long time for me. I know that if I get that position, I will be successful with high salary and stable job. However, the path to success is extreamly difficult so I believe that I am not persistent enough to pursue this job.

                <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the
                    size
                    of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                    fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.

                    this has to change a man.</p>

                <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year
                    mission:

                <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a
