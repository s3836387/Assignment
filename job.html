                <p>Iced Tea is made from four people who have a wide choice of jobs like data engineer, product manager,
                    software architect. Those are jobs that have a big impact on the IT industry as well as developing
                    technology. According to Burning Glass, they have given much data about IT so the Ice Tea group will
                    use it to evaluate membersâ€™ ideal jobs. The soft skills required by the company are in the top 5 by
                    source labor insight jobs (burning glass technologies). However, most companies often require staff
                    to be fluent in javascript, java, and python languages. In three specific IT skills ranked highest,
                    the SQL programming language is not required in these companies. However, nearly companies recommend
                    that employees have skills such as communication, organizational skills ,and problem-solving which
                    ranks in the top 3. Finally, the ideal jobs the team intends to do appear in the top general skills
                    and specific skills that most companies require.</p>
                <p>

                <h3 class="section-heading mt-3">Khai</h3>
                <p>My ideal job product manager, but since the job is not in high demand according to Burning Glass
                    data, and I want to gain some experiences first. My second ideal job is Test analyst, which
                    according to Burning Glass 2018 "Labor Insight Jobs" is among the top demand job (555). Furthermore,
                    from the Burning Glass data one of the top generic skills in IT, besides problem-solving skills, is
                    communication. I am a good problem solver but lack face-to-face communication skills. Besides that,
                    one of the skills that surprise me in top IT skills is business skills (analysis, management, and
                    relationship building). However, some of the top IT skills are in my skill set (SQL, Java, C#).
                    Finally, after looking at the Burning Glass data, some of my opinions have changed, like you need a
                    lot of communication skills and some business knowledge. But it does not change what my ideal was.

                <p>I want to be a data engineer and it encouraged me to feel like I would like to be dealing with
                    technology in the future while I heard about it. Particularly when finishing a code it helps to feel
                    like an expert and makes me feel more confident when it works. This is a job that is not in TOP IT
                    Jobs because I think this is a difficult job and you need to master a lot of things if you want this
                    job to develop well. First of all, I need to get a science and programming bachelor's degree, or a
                    master's degree or professor would be a huge help for me to get the position I want. Secondly, I
                    need expertise in data processing and problem-solving in many approaches; it will help me improve my
                    work with many opportunities.Lastly, I need to have at least 2 years' experience in the development
                    of python and java applications. In fact, Scala or Kotlin will give you an advantage over python and
                    java. I don't have much knowledge and ability at the moment. I will try hard for my job and my
                    vision in the future. I should learn more tools like Scala or Kotin to have more chances of working
                    here. I'll be investing a lot of time holistically improving it and getting it easier. Communication
                    skill is a very important soft skill because it will help us gain the trust of everyone around us.
                    When we communicate well, it will make it easier for us to talk about a problem. I am quite
                    confident in my communication skills when convincing others because when I communicate, people often
                    want to listen to my stories and sympathize with me.

                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Ngan</h2>

                <p>My ideal job is a software architect. My job requires that having at least 10 years of experience in
                    software development according to labour insight jobs burning glass technologies(532). The software
                    Developer ranks first with top burning glass occuptions(29,456). This job needs organisational
                    skills which usually in the top 5(15,844) from May 2017 to march 2018 about skills in greatest
                    demand. About programming langugues, employees need proficent in HTML and Javascript. JavaSript is
                    always in the top 3(2,946) while HTML is greatly reduced from May 2017 to march 2018. I think i will
                    change my ideal job in the future because I recognize that I will lose 10 years in order to achive
                    this job and it was a long time for me. I know that if I get that position, I will be successful
                    with high salary and stable job. However, the path to success is extreamly difficult so I believe
                    that I am not persistent enough to pursue this job.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Hoang Dung</h2>
                <p>My ideal job is Data Engineer in Python or Java which have among 600 to 700 job postings.
                    To apply to this job, I need to have 2 year-experience in working advanced in Python or Java.
                    Moreover, I also have to working in SQL, Linux OS for more than 2 years.
                    English is also a strong advanced for me thank for learning at RMIT.


                    My skills still not meet with the top skill in the Burning Data.
                    Three top skills on the board is SQL, JavaScript, JAVA which have above 2.700 job postings.
                    Those are skills related mostly in IT work so there is no doubt about it important.
                    However, Python and Git only have about 1.000 job postings and those are high-rate skills which have
                    a high recommend so it can support me a lot in my ideal job.

                    I think I wonâ€™t change my choice to become a data engineer.
                    It is my dream so I want to focus on it all the time.
                    I hope in the future the rank of data engineer will get more respect due to the large amount of data
                    has been created today.
