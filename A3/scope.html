                <p>
                    As we have stated many time in the previous sections, due to limited time and resources, we will
                    only do phase 1 which is motion detection. The second phase of our project proved to be too
                    difficult and there is no suitable technology that can recreate feedback effect at the moment. In
                    contrast to
                    that, the suit is achievable if we only do the motion detection part, as some company have already
                    made a similiar suit.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3"></h2>
                <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    As you can see on our website, our VR suit is the most developed technology to support gamer in
                    order to improve their experience while playing games. Our VR suit used some kind of technology like
                    Vive or Oculus with a kinetic mirror. Vive and Oculus provide VR technology software that will
                    support the hardware part of the kinetic mirror. The kinetic mirror is a very new technology because
                    it just has been created recently. It has been improved that very fit for our project and helps our
                    project get optimized.
                </p>
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    After finishing the prototype, we will let people test our suit. First, we will let our team member
                    test and check whether it has any more bugs so that we can fix it early. Secondly, I am a member of
                    the RMIT E-sport Club which gathers many gamers who have a strong passion for games so we can have a
                    lot of people to help us evaluate our prototype. We have to make sure that the suit can be fit for
                    everybody and they are all felt comfortable when wearing it. In addition, we will modify it to
                    provide the most wonderful gaming device to experience to all gamers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please note that we have discussed in detailed most of our progress and plan in our <a href=""> Plan
                        and
                        Progress</a> section.
                </p>
                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>
                    VR suit is a new and early technology. Therefore, risks always exist and we have to determine and
                    develop it in order to keep safe to testers and users. In our project, some special risks can be
                    caused to the users like disconnection to the suit, the signal of interacting too strong which
                    causes injuries to users. Moreover, the suit can cause skin problems such as allergy.</p>
                <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
                <p>
                    We have a regular team meeting every Monday. We usually spend about 1 to 2 hours to discuss the
                    project and our jobs. In addition, we show the progress to each other in order to improve and help
                    to finish our work more efficiently. Facebook messenger is the most common way we use to do our
                    tasks and discuss them with other group members. We also use something like Teams when we want to
                    show each other our works. Moreover, we use Github to collab on our A3 and pitch presentaion.
                </p>
