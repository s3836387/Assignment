                <h2 class="section-heading">Group Reflection</h2>
                <p>After working together in 3 weeks, Iced Tea group which includes Khai, Ngan, Dung, and Minh Anh, was
                    completed the assignment. We did a good job of sharing the work and having the content because we
                    split each part equally among the members so no one does too much or too little. About the content,
                    many opinions are given so there is a lot of controversies, but we all try to agree on the same
                    opinion. We need to improve our web programming skills so that we can do it more effectively because
                    Khai knows web-making well, so he does the difficult parts, and the other 3 members do the easy
                    parts of web programming. Therefore, we need to improve our knowledge to be able to do the difficult
                    parts and can also set up a professional website for ourselves. Additionally, we should have more
                    meetings to motivate members to work because when we do together, we will be easy to ask team
                    members. Ngan studies in a different tutorial class with other 3 members of the group so it tends to
                    be difficult for us to meet each other. Hence, we should make appointments, all members gathered to
                    work. What surprised us the most was the help between the team members. Everyone always helps each
                    other when facing difficulties, not alone. Usually, the groups will split the work and do it
                    themselves, but Iced Tea group is different, we always support each other, when members have
                    problems, they just need to message on Facebook and the other members will assist immediately. One
                    lesson we learned from forming Iced Tea group is teamwork and Organisational skills. We acknowledge
                    that although the team has many good members, they do not have solidarity, they will not be able to
                    get the job done. We know how to organize the tasks for the team members very well in order to be
                    fair to everyone.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Khai</h2>
                <p>The group has done well in terms of finishing each member assigned tasks. Most members have followed
                    the deadline decided by the group, but there are still some members who did not follow the deadline
                    strictly (finished the task a bit late). There is room for improvement like plan the workflow more
                    carefully and work on the project sooner. The things that surprise me the most are some of the
                    members managed to finished all the assigned tasks within an acceptable timeframe. Moreover, the
                    GitHub collab went more smoothly than I expected. Compare to my last group from the previous
                    semester, we did not run into any merge conflict or lose any files. Moving on to another project, I
                    have learned which group member needs more attention to make sure he stays on track with the team.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Ngan</h2>

                <p>In my group, I think I have not done really well in terms of giving my opinion to the members.
                    However, I have contributed to the industry data section, I have compiled metrics from team members
                    and given information sources to give readers an overview of the requirements of the work team
                    members intend to do. Furthermore, I completed IT Technologies on time and I posted to the Git as
                    quickly as possible so that my team members can check and correct mistakes. I have completed
                    individual sections on time so that Khai can have more time in order to help me with writing code.
                    Additionally, I also contributed to the group reflection section, I help my team to recognize their
                    shortcomings and the lessons they learned from this assignment. I hope I can study more about writing code from Khai. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Hoang Dung</h2>
                <p>After working together in 3 weeks, we have understood more about each other. At first members seem to confused about their work.
                  Therefore, they delay the time to hand in their part and we have a very hard time.
                  However, we have overcome it and finish our work on time. All members help each other very well to finish their parts, especially in
                  Githuh. We just get used to know about it and we don’t have time to understand about use it to collab. Surprisingly, we go over it
                  quite easy and doesn’t have any conflict about using Github. I think we have done a very great job in work although this is the first
                   time we do it as a group. However, I think we can improve more if we know to fix our common mistake like lazy in work or get
                   distraction in building idea.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Minh Anh</h2>
                <p>We have done a great job in dividing the work each person needs to do and it is doing very well in
                    the homework. I think my team divided the work fairly evenly and it made me feel good about it. I
                    think I need to concentrate more in writing because it takes me a lot of time to think and search
                    for information related to the article. What surprised me the most was Khai because he has a lot of
                    code that we don't know yet and he helps us a lot in the code. I learned a lot from my team from the
                    presentation and how to streamline the work so that I feel lighter in the upcoming work. </p>
