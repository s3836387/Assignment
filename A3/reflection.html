                <h2 class="section-heading">Group Reflection</h2>
                <p>After working together in 3 weeks, the Iced Tea group which includes Khai, Ngan, Dung, and Minh Anh,
                    was completed the assignment. When we did assignment 2, we learned a lot from it such as teamwork
                    skills and job organization skills so when we start to do assignment 3, we do not worry much because
                    we understand each other. About the content, because we are doing about VR suit which is very little
                    information available online and it is incredibly difficult to implement, even for those who
                    specialize in the industry. Therefore, In the plan and progress part, we do not have a lot of ideas
                    for it. We need to improve our web programming skills so that we can do it more effectively because
                    Khai knows web-making well, so he does the difficult parts, and the other 3 members do the easy
                    parts of web programming. Therefore, we need to improve our knowledge to be able to do the difficult
                    parts and can also set up a professional website for ourselves. Moreover, we need to find out more
                    information about the product we are working on because many products are not easy to do so we
                    should think carefully before working on a project. Additionally, we should have more meetings to
                    motivate members to work because when we do together, we will be easy to ask team members. Ngan
                    studies in a different tutorial class with other 3 members of the group so it tends to be difficult
                    for us to meet each other. What surprised us the most was the help between the team members.
                    Everyone always helps each other when facing difficulties, not alone. Usually, the groups will split
                    the work and do it themselves, but the Iced Tea group is different, we always support each other,
                    when members have problems, they just need to message on Facebook and the other members will assist
                    immediately. One lesson we learned after forming the group is teamwork and organization skills. In
                    addition to those skills we also learned to think carefully before making decisions, like we need to
                    think about the future when working on it not only because it is easy to do now. We acknowledge that
                    although the team has many good members, they do not have solidarity, they will not be able to get
                    the job done. We know how to organize the tasks for the team members very well to be fair to
                    everyone.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Khai</h2>
                <p>Our group, for the most part, has worked smoothly with each other. As time goes on, our communication
                    has improved, and we got used to each other. Furthermore, for this assignment, the group has
                    successfully worked independently in a smaller group and got everything done on time. For me, I have
                    now known whom to trust and gave her a leading role in that group. Because of that, it has reduced
                    my workload and responsibilities. However, one thing that still needs to improve is our group plan
                    to do the assignment. Like last time, this time the group finished pretty close to the assignment
                    deadline and not leaving much time for reviewing the report. Apart from that, one thing that
                    surprised me this time is how Dung work. He had finished all the tasks assigned to him before the
                    team deadline and willing to do more. In addition to that, Ngan also finished the tasks I gave her
                    sooner than expected, so there is some improvement from their perspective. Because of that, I have
                    learned to give people more responsibility for their work and divide our workload more evenly among
                    everyone. Finally, just like last time, our team use GitHub to collab with each other, although this
                    time we did not use it as much since only two people are writing the main part of A3. Hence there is
                    not a lot of commits from Ngan and Minh Anh.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Ngan Phan</h2>
                <p>In my group, I think I have not done really well in terms of giving my opinion to the members.
                    Because we did the assignment 2 together so we have known about the strengths and weaknesses of each
                    other so we split the appropriate parts, members who do good a part will be assigned to do this
                    part. Therefore, I have contributed to do the presentation, I have searched for the images for the
                    slides, and because I like the design for the poster and drawing pictures so I am responsible for
                    the design slides to make them look attractive to the audience. Additionally, Designing the slides
                    is difficult because the different members are separated so they don't have the same opinion, so I
                    consulted the members many times to give a general idea for the slides. Furthermore, I also
                    contributed to the group reflection section, I help my team to recognize their shortcomings and the
                    lessons they learned from this assignment. Because this part has a low score in assignment 2, I am
                    worried to do this so I told the members who will do well this part, but they believe I will do
                    better. I hope I can study more about writing code from Khai and have a good group refection.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Hoang Dung</h2>
                <p>
                    Our group have the time to work together on the Assignment 2. Therefore, we can divide the works to
                    be suitable for group members. I take part in doing research about tools & technologies, test, risk
                    and skills & jobs. Doing research about these topics allow me to acknowledge a lot of useful
                    information. I share these works with my leader because we are the one who understand the project
                    most among the group members. Moreover, I think that I have done my work better and faster compare
                    to the work progress I have done in Assignment 2. Therefore, our tasks have the finish time faster
                    than normal and we can use the spare time to check the project again and prepare for the
                    presentation which is very important on this semester. I am still very bad at connecting with the
                    members in my group and still let the leader ask me to finish my work. This is the things I have to
                    change if I want to improve myself and get a higher mark at next semester. I feel very grateful to
                    my group members thanks to their help that help me during my studying time.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Minh Anh</h2>
                <p>
                    Assignment 2 made us closer together when we finished it together. After that, we shared very easily
                    and equally with each other knowing who had strengths in different parts. I think I'll do a good job
                    of research and I often share my ideas with the team. I thank people so much for helping me so much
                    in doing the post. I often forget what I need to do so people often remind me to finish my part.
                    They usually care about me when I don't know how to do it, they can change me, and the part and I
                    feel very happy about it. I often ask parts I don't know and everyone just burns enthusiastically.
                    The post we finished early and we had more time to prepare for our presentation and the wire was
                    also the part that I felt most worried about. I can't link or support the team much in terms of
                    knowledge, but I can do a good job of connecting team members together and trying to do the best
                    part that I'm assigned. I am very proud of my team and I hope the following courses can be shared
                    and done with them.
