                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Khai</h2>
                <p>After ten weeks of working together with the team, I have gotten to know everyone pretty well and
                    gained some experience in managing a project. For me, I think I have tried my best to distribute the
                    team workload and push the project to finish. However, there are still some aspects that I need to
                    improve, like setting a mini deadline and communicating effectively with everyone. For everyone
                    else, I think they have done a good job of carrying their own weight. For Ngan, I think she is the
                    most responsible one out of three members. Moreover, she is willing to take some challenges in the
                    assignment. In this assignment, I have assigned her to be the leader for the presentation part of
                    our assignment, and she did it very well. For Dung, I think he more hardworking in this assignment,
                    although he still waits pretty close to the deadline to do his tasks. However, he did get all the
                    job I assigned to him well and sooner than I expected. Lastly, M.Anh, I for this assignment, I think
                    he has improved a lot but there is still room for improvement for him. Moreover, because he has lost
                    his student ID card, we were not able to talk to him face-to-face for several weeks. However, as
                    Ngan reported, he did carry his weight this assignment and not being lazy. Overall, I still think
                    the team communication have improve a lot since our first weeks working together with each other.
                    Furthermore, I think some of them have begun to mature and completed their work before the deadline
                    set by the team. This is one the improvement I hope will continue.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Ngan Phan</h2>
                <p>Because we did assignment 2 together and we also have known each other about our strengths and
                    weakness so, in assignment 3, we are easy to exchange information. My team is doing quite well, all
                    members are equally given the same work. Regarding the content, it is difficult to find out the
                    information about our product, so we are trouble with this section. Khai is the person who writes
                    the most code because he has a lot of knowledge about creating a good website, he did a great job in
                    this aspect and he helped other members when they have problems with coding, but he also gave the
                    difficult topic which is complicated to discover its information. Dung is the one who is quite lazy,
                    because he does not understand more about coding so he makes some mistakes on the website, but he
                    usually completes his assigned work well, he completed his work on time so a leader who is Khai can
                    have more time to check. Anh Minh does not wait for the last days of the deadline to start working
                    like assignment 2 but he needs someone to remind to do his job so sometime he forgot to do it, but
                    He is good at finding information when I cannot have any idea, he also gives me ideas and also find
                    the information for me. I am bad at coding so sometimes I make Khai angry because I make coding
                    wrong and the website becomes a trouble and he lost more time to fix it. Therefore, my members do
                    not let me do the coding part, I am responsible for the content for the group, I help them to find
                    the images for the presentation, I also design the slides and the member in the group will watch it
                    and they will give me their ideas so that I can change and everybody is satisfied.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Hoang Dung</h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to our cooperation on the Assignment 2, we have understood our strong and weak so that we can
                    give each other help when there is a need between members. We have divided the work quite equally.
                    Khai nearly take all the hard part while he creating the code and designing our group website. He
                    also spends time to check our work to make sure that we are doing right. Ngan have to collect the
                    data and create the presentation for our group so that we can have time to do other things and
                    tasks. Minh Anh is quite lazy in his work and we have to encourage him to finish his work on time.
                    However, he tries very hard to learn new things and focus on his work. I work with Khai on doing
                    research about our group project VR suit. I think I doing my works faster than before so that our
                    group have more time to sit together and look again our jobs. In addition, our group have a good
                    work and members are knowing which ways to do their task more efficiency to help other members.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mt-3">Minh Anh</h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to assignment 2 it allowed us to see each other's strengths and weaknesses and from there it
                    was easier for us to divide everyone into the right parts for them. Khai often does the code parts
                    and the code parts because he does code and decorates very well, so that part is very suitable for
                    him. He is the one who divides the work for everyone on the team and often helps everyone on the
                    team when it is difficult. Dung is a very good performer in writing and research. He often
                    contributes good ideas to the group when the group needs to find other solutions. Ngan is the only
                    girl in the group, but she does almost everything well and she helps me out when I don't understand
                    because I often ask her what I don't know, and she is willing to help me. I am a person who is often
                    prompted to do my parts because I often forget the parts that I need to do. I am good at research
                    and comments which will help the team a small part in solving problems.
