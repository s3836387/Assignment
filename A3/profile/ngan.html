                    <p> My name is Ngan, my nickname in my group is chicken and I am from Vietnam. My ID is s3863893 and
                        my email address is s3863893@gmail.com. About my hobbies, I want to become a streamer game, now
                        I am streaming game PUBG on Facebook.I love to read comics about love and compose comics, I now
                        have ideas for my story but I am busy studying so I have to postpone it.I like playing
                        instruments like drums, piano and flute but currently I am practicing playing guitar and piano.
                        About IT interest and IT experience, actually, I have no interest in IT and I select IT major
                        because my mother forces me to learn it. When I started to learn IT, I am very worried because
                        when i was in high school, my school did not teach much about computer science. However, after 4
                        weeks of studying, I realize that IT is very enjoyable because I can know the way they create
                        games for player and I also want to do that. I choose to come to RMIT because my mother told me
                        that I could chance to study abroad. Now I do not have much in-depth programming knowledge so I
                        expect this course will help me improve my skills and I can pursue that dream of making games
                        for my girlfriend.</p>

                        This personality of mine will affect the formation of groups because I am an introvert person so
                        I am difficult to describe my concept
                        and I can not chat with some group members whom I do not know. I think I will work well with
                        Khai who is in same group as me because he has a similar personality to me, I will be easy to
                        exchange information with him. I am a visual learner with 45%. This result is very true to me
                        because I learn by reading or seeing pictures I
                        understand and remember everything with my eyes. When I work in a team, I help them set the
                        group's goals and develop the opinion of the members. i am difficult to work with Dung who is a
                        auditory learner because I think I combine well with Dung who is a auditory learner because his
                        ability to hear and absord lessons is very good. With my creativity,
                        my creativity is only 38.65% so in the teamwork, I had a hard time figuring out an idea for the
                        group and I could only understand the opinions of others and develop them.

                    <p>
                        I am intrigued by the software architect job which combined a lot of soft skills such as
                        leadership skills, teamwork skills and communication skills. My job needs conditions quite
                        similar with the jobs of Khai and Dung are we all work with team, have many years experience
                        about software development and know programming in several languages such as HTML, Java and
                        Linux. I think my job will lose over 10 years to achive this job and my job will be harder to
                        achieve than my friends’s job because it requires worker have to have a high experience in
                        software development and software system architecture. I think my plan is different with my
                        friends because they write clearly the goals of the month and the year and they give themselves
                        the work they need to do. About me, I just write about what I should do to improve subjects such
                        as I decided to take extra classses outside to improve my knowledge and I need to do more
                        exercises in order to remember the lectures well.

                    <p>
                        For assignment 3, I think the group have work more effectively than assignment. This might be we
                        are used to each other and all the app we are using to collab. Moreover, this time we have
                        decided to split the group up into two smaller to tackle the presentation slides and A3 at the
                        same time.

                        I am intrigued by the software architect job which combined a lot of soft skills such as

                        Linux. My team has the common points of needing to have a long experience and knoww a variety of
                        programming languages. I think my job will lose over 10 years to achive this job and my job will
                        be harder to achieve than my friends’s job because it requires worker have to have a high
                        experience in software development and software system architecture. In the assignment 2, I
                        think my plan is different with my friends because they write clearly the goals of the month and
                        the year and they give themselves the work they need to do, I also changed my plan, I want to
                        see my clear goals for achieving this job and to pursue this job, I have ro persevere and make
                        more effort. I need to come up with a list of each month each year what I need to achieve and
                        what I have not achieved will take long. I do when I do so it will help motivate me and know the
                        path I am taking.
