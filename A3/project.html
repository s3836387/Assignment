                <h2 class="section-heading" id="overview">Overview</h2>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="topic">Topic</h3>
                <p> VR/AR technology is on the rise, and along with it is the gaming experience. Moreover, with the
                    current pandemic, we could see the high demand for this kind of technology. Some of the reasons why
                    this kind of technology is in need are to enhance the experience of interacting and communicating
                    with other people digitally; to escape reality for relaxation or immerse yourself in another world.
                    And since our team is composed of gamers, we have decided on our project idea to be a VR suit ( or
                    haptic suit).
                    Our project originally has to main parts, body motion detection and sensor feedback system, but due
                    to limited time and resources, we will only do the first part. The suit will be able to capture the
                    user motion more accurately and let the user move more freely than what the current VR system offer.
                    It is composed of two main components, upper-body and lower-body, both can work independently with
                    each other. Because of that, the suit has many other usages outside of gaming, like for animation
                    motion capture, medical training, combat training etc. Therefore, our main focus on this project is
                    to capture the body motion as accurate as possible.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
                <p> Our main motivation for this project is for gaming usage. However, this technology could be used
                    in
                    many ways. For example, medical rehabilitation, the suit pulse could provide valuable feedback for
                    restoring the movements of a patient. Furthermore, the doctor could also collect data from the suit
                    to
                    provide better treatment for the patient. Additionally, the suit could also be use in the animation
                    field, where animator could use the suit to track and create animation faster.</p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="landscape">Landscape</h3>
                <p>
                    The VR/AR technology have been on the rise in recent years. The market is dominated by two big
                    company that produce VR related system exclusively, HTC Vive and Oculus (brand of Facebook
                    Technologies). The VR system produce by those two company use a similar technology, which have a
                    headset, two controller and four sensors that the user will set up around the environment. In
                    addition to that, there are two company that produce a similar product to ours, that is Bhaptics and
                    Teslasuit. There are not too many differences between our project and the product they are making,
                    but we are planning to make it more affordable, people can mod it and make it open source. Moreover,
                    if possible, we would also want to discover if there is a more efficient and accurate way to track
                    user motion.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading" id="description">Description</h2>
                <p>
                    A haptic suit is a suit or a set of components that lets the user experience the VR world more
                    immersively. The suit would have some kind of motion sensors on it for tracking the user movements.
                    Furthermore, the suit would also have a feedback mechanism that lets the user feel the virtual
                    objects.
                    One of the ways the sensors work is to detect the electrical activity of the user's muscle and link
                    it
                    to a specific motion. Or we could have different detection points on the suit and have the motion
                    sensor
                    surround the user like current Vive or Oculus technology. Moreover, the haptic suit would also be
                    some
                    kind of technology to generate the sensation of feeling on the user's skin. We do not think this
                    technology existed yet, but we think we could assemble something related to it by using heat pads or
                    a
                    pain stimulator (turn down) to stimulate the pain. Or we could also use technology like the <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV8v2GKC8WA">kinetic
                        mirror</a> , with many dots, to simulate the touch feeling. Another approach is we can make a
                    layer of
                    the
                    suit to be inflatable to simulate pressure. Next, we would need a mini processor to process all the
                    raw
                    data from the suit and output it to a receiver. Moreover, the processor would also house some kind
                    of AI
                    to process all the movement and manage the suit function.

                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading" id="aim">Aim</h2>
                <p>
                    Our aim for this project is to finish phase 1 (or parts of it), which is the full-body motion
                    detection function. Currently, most VR technology only allows the user to use their upper body
                    (hands and head). Because of that, our main goal is to develop a suit that allows the user to move
                    freely in the virtual world while wearing it (upper-body and lower-body). And to achieve this goal,
                    we would have to divide our project into sub goals. </p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="goal1">Goal 1: Choose a motion detection method</h3>
                <p> First and foremost, we will need to decide what kind of motion detection method we want to
                    use. The reason this goal is significant to the project is everything we are going to develop will
                    be based on which path we took. There are several types of method that big companies are using, like
                    VR tracking with Optic, placing sensors around the user environment, and use trackers to track user
                    motion (like Vive Cosmos and Oculus Rift); or Non-optical VR tracking, use electromechanical sensors
                    such as gyroscopes to track motion (the PS4 controller) or Myo armband which tracks electrical
                    impulse from the muscles.</p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="goal2">Goal 2: Develop upper-body and arm components</h3>
                <p> After we have decided which method, we want to base our project on, we will start to develop
                    the arm and upper body motion detection. Whichever method we choose to use, our aim in this goal is
                    to use that motion detection method and detect our arm motion. And since arm motion detection is the
                    most basic function in all the methods, it will be beneficial for us to achieve this goal early on.
                    Moreover, it would also help us to familiarize ourselves with the technology we choose.</p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="goal3">Goal 3: Develop lower-body component and connection</h3>
                <p> Our third goal is to develop the lower body component of the suit and connect it with the
                    upper body component. The reason this goal seems longer than the previous goals is the extra step of
                    connecting to the upper body component. Moreover, this task could be a bit challenging since we have
                    to make sure that the lower component works smoothly (no misinterpretation, no conflict) with the
                    upper component. Furthermore, assuming we have already achieved the previous goals, the motion
                    detection function of the lower body component will be just like the upper body component.</p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="goal4">Goal 4: Develop hand gesture detection</h3>
                <p> Our fourth goal is to develop the hand gesture detection function. Because of how many
                    gestures our hand can produce, this would probably be one of the most challenging components.
                    Furthermore, our hand is the most important tool on our body, so this function must run smoothly and
                    accurately.</p>
                <h3 class="section-heading" id="goal5">Goal 5: Refinement</h3>
                <p> Our final goal is to make sure that everything will work smoothly with each other. Before we
                    can move on to the next phase of our project, we want to make sure that the motion tracking function
                    of the suit is working as intended. However, we are going to refine our motion tracking function to
                    an extent as not everything will work perfectly, and we cannot work on it forever. Therefore, the
                    goal is satisfied when there are not any major glitches.
                    The goals are organized by their priority in phase 1 of the project. If things do not go as
                    expected, we will try and finish, at least, the second goal. Because of how fundamental and
                    beneficial to finish the second goal is, it is our top priority. If we successfully achieve the
                    second goal, we would also acquire the knowledge to do part of the third goal.</p>
