                <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
                <p> VR/AR technology is on the rise, and along with it is the gaming experience. Moreover, with the
                    current
                    pandemic, we could see the high demand for this kind of technology. Some of the reasons why this
                    kind of
                    technology is in need are to enhance the experience of interacting and communicating with other
                    people
                    digitally; to escape reality for relaxation or immerse yourself in another world. And since our team
                    is
                    composed of gamers, we have decided on our project idea to be a VR suit ( or haptic suit).
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Motivation</h2>
                <p> Our central motivation for this project is for gaming usage. However, this technology could be used
                    in
                    many ways. For example, medical rehabilitation, the suit pulse could provide valuable feedback for
                    restoring the movements of a patient. Furthermore, the doctor could also collect data from the suit
                    to
                    provide better treatment for the patient.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>
                <p>
                    A haptic suit is a suit or a set of components that lets the user experience the VR world more
                    immersively. The suit would have some kind of motion sensors on it for tracking the user movements.
                    Furthermore, the suit would also have a feedback mechanism that lets the user feel the virtual
                    objects.
                    One of the ways the sensors work is to detect the electrical activity of the user's muscle and link
                    it
                    to a specific motion. Or we could have different detection points on the suit and have the motion
                    sensor
                    surround the user like current Vive or Oculus technology. Moreover, the haptic suit would also be
                    some
                    kind of technology to generate the sensation of feeling on the user's skin. We do not think this
                    technology existed yet, but we think we could assemble something related to it by using heat pads or
                    a
                    pain stimulator (turn down) to stimulate the pain. Or we could also use technology like the <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV8v2GKC8WA">kinetic
                        mirror</a> , with many dots, to simulate the touch feeling. Another approach is we can make a
                    layer of
                    the
                    suit to be inflatable to simulate pressure. Next, we would need a mini processor to process all the
                    raw
                    data from the suit and output it to a receiver. Moreover, the processor would also house some kind
                    of AI
                    to process all the movement and manage the suit function.

                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Tools</h2>
                <p>
                    However, to make this suit a reality, it would take us a lot of time, and with our current skill and
                    knowledge, it is not feasible. What we could do now is to divide the suit up into different
                    components
                    and make it individually. Moreover, we could also divide the suit development phase into two, motion
                    detection and suit feedback system. The motion detection will be easier to develop because most of
                    the
                    technologies are already there. Some examples are the CyberGloves 2 by CyberGloves systems and the
                    Teslasuit Glove by TESLASUIT which have now enabled the user to feel virtual objects. The suit
                    feedback
                    system would be harder to develop since most of the technology is not there yet.
                    Finally, the main outcome of our project is to make some parts of the suit to work. And to make this
                    idea become a reality, we would need to take it step-by-step.</p>
