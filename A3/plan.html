        <h3 id="what">What is our project</h3>
        <p>
          Our project came into fruition after we watch the 2018 movie "Ready Player One" in which the main character
          wore the suit to play his game more immersive. Moreover, because all of our team members are gamer, we were
          super motivated and inspire by that concept. As the name suggested, our project lets you fully interact with
          the virtual environment while wearing the suit. What makes the suit special is that it can track your every
          movement more accurately than the normal VR controller. Furthermore, ideally, if more time and resources are
          permitted, our suit would also have sensor feedback just like in the movie.
        </p>
        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
        <p>
          A haptic suit is composed of components that lets the user experience the VR world more immersive. The suit
          would have some kind of motion sensors on it for tracking the user movements. Furthermore, the suit would also
          have a feedback mechanism that lets the user feel the virtual objects. One of the ways the sensors work is to
          detect the electrical activity of the user's muscle and link it to a specific motion. Or we could have
          different detection points on the suit and have the motion sensor surround the user like current Vive or
          Oculus technology. Moreover, the haptic suit would also be some kind of technology to generate the sensation
          of feeling on the user's skin. We do not think this technology existed yet, but we think we could assemble
          something related to it by using heat pads or a pain stimulator (turn down) to stimulate the pain. Or we could
          also use technology like the kinetic mirror , with many dots, to simulate the touch feeling. Another approach
          is we can make a layer of the suit to be inflatable to simulate pressure. Next, we would need a mini processor
          to process all the raw data from the suit and output it to a receiver. Moreover, the processor would also
          house some kind of AI to process all the movement and manage the suit function.
        </p>
        <h3 id="plan">Plan and progress</h3>
        For the first three weeks, all group members worked together to brainstorm and develop the project idea. This
        will ensure that everyone will get a saying in the project and find out who is best leader for each phase of the
        project. Furthermore, since we do not have enough time, we will only be focused on one of the core functions of
        the project, which is the motion tracking function. <br>
        Moreover, because we want to keep track of the progress of the project, we will be using our goals as anchor
        points and project map. Moreover, using our goals as anchor points will also ensure our project stay on track
        and prevent any ‘project creep’.</p>

            here</a> to view our timeframe table
        </p>
        <h5 id="goal1">Goal 1: Decide what kind of motion detection method we want to use.</h5>
        <p>
          Duration: 1-2 weeks <br>
          Feasibility
          For our first goal, we want to spend some amount of time to choose the appropriate technology and tracking
          method we will be using. This is, undoubtedly, the most important step in our project, since each technology
          will have a different implement method. The main problem we would have in this step is the availability of
          other
          VR technologies like the Myo armband or the Vive Tracker for us to test. Furthermore, to compare each
          technology
          equally, we would also have to make a test to measure the result. For example, this test could be about the
          motion tracking accuracy of each method or the response time of each technology. The technology we will choose
          to use would have to fulfill some requirements like strong code community and customizable
        </p>
        <h5 id="goal2">Goal 2: Develop arm and upper body motion detection</h5>
        <p>
          Duration: 3-5 weeks <br>
          For this step, for the first couple of weeks, we will be designing and making our prototype of the arm and the
          upper body motion detector. By this point, we would have already decided on which kind of technology we want
          to
          use and so we will build our prototype base on that. After we are satisfied with the prototype, we will begin
          to
          build our first version of the arm and the upper body motion detector. Furthermore, before moving onto the
          next
          step, we would also have to ensure that the component work properly and only have some minor errors.
        </p>
        <h5 id="goal3">Goal 3: Develop lower body motion detection and connect it to upper body component</h5>
        <p>
          Duration: 3 - 5 weeks <br>
          For the first part of this step, just like the previous step, the first couple of weeks would also be for
          designing and making a prototype. However, we predict that it will be faster than the previous step since we
          only have to make remakes the technology a bit. After we are done with the prototype, we will also be making
          the
          first version of this component and test it for bugs and errors. We will be moving onto the next part after
          most
          major bugs have been fixed. <br>
          The second part of this step is to ensure that two components (upper and lower body) can work smoothly with
          each
          other. For this part we have two potential methods that could work: connect both parts to a microprocessor or
          connect them directly into the computer. The latter could put a lot of loads on the user computer CPU.
        </p>
        <h5 id="goal4">Goal 4: Hand gesture detection</h5>
        <p>
          Duration: 2-3 weeks <br>
          For this step, we will develop a type of gloves that can detect which hand gestures you are making. Just like
          the previous step, the first week would also be for prototyping. There are some methods we are considered
          using:
          a glove with sensors on the joints of each finger or implement the technology use in the Myo armband. The
          first
          method is more straightforward than the second, but it could increase the processing time of the suit with all
          the added sensors (14 sensors/hand). The latter method will be a hybrid between two motion detection method,
          where we implement the Myo armband into our suit.
        </p>
        <h5 id="goal5">Goal 5: Refinement.</h5>
        <p>
          Duration: 1-2 weeks <br>
          In our final step, we will continue to test all the components to see how well it work together. We will
          design
          and conduct some tests on the suit accuracy and response time to further fine-tune it. The main goal for this
          step is to find and fix all the major bugs that might have arisen when we put all components together.
        </p>
        <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
        <p>
        <h6>Product manager (Khai Ngo)</h6>
        <p>I am doing this role because this is my ideal job and I want to practice leading a team. My responsibility is
          to keep track of everyone progress and make sure every member know what they are doing. Additionally, it is
          great oppotunity for me to practice my communication skill as I have to communicate well with everyone in the
          team. Finally, I am also responsible for planning and distribute work for all member in the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside the Product manager role, all member will take turn being the leader for each phases of the project.
          The group will vote the leader of each phases by the knowledge they konw about that step. Additionally, this
          system will ensure that everyone have a chance to experience leading a team. The two role that will change
          week by week is the Lead Developer and Technical Designer. <br>
          Lead Developer: He/She will be responsible for designing and lead the coding aspect of our project. He/She
          will also design the structure of our software (which code patterns), divide the code to all the member,
          combine and finalize all the codes. <br>
          Technical Designer: He/She will work closely with the Lead Developer to design our system. He/She will
          responsible for design the our system structure, how our software and firmware connect to each other, and how
          that component will look like.
